These programs run only on Mac with Accelerate framework.
Please compile with Accelerate framework e.g. "g++ [name] -framework Accelerate".

Please download "leukemia_big (dot) csv" from "web (dot) stanford (dot) edu /~hastie/CASI_files/DATA/leukemia (dot) html" and put it in the same location as the executable file.
